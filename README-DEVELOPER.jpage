/*
 * Dear Mod Authors,
 * this is the basic documentation file of the craftdev library.

General Notes:
	
	please ALWAYS add this as dependency-string in your @Mod annotation:
		"required-after:craftdev-core"
		
		Example: @Mod(modid="modid", name="mod", dependencies="required-after:craftdev-core")

	also make sure that CraftDevCore.getCodeBase() returns the same number as the version your mod was built against. Different values SHOULD NOT be supported!
